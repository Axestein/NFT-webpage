PROBLEM STATEMENT- 
In the rapidly evolving landscape of digital assets, the absence of standardized protocols and interoperability challenges within the Non-Fungible Token (NFT) ecosystem hinders widespread adoption and limits the seamless exchange of unique digital assets. The lack of universally accepted standards for metadata, smart contract functionality, and cross-chain compatibility creates barriers for artists, collectors, and developers, preventing the full realization of NFTs' potential as a versatile and widely accessible digital asset class. Addressing these challenges is crucial for fostering innovation, ensuring fair compensation for creators, and establishing a sustainable and inclusive NFT ecosystem for all stakeholders involved.
